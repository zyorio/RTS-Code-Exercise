This folder contains the files for the RTS Labs Code Exercise. Python code was developed in version 3.7

RTS_Question1.py takes two inputs from the user, an array of numbers entered one at a time, and a number to compare against the array. 
The output is the count of integers in the array that are above the comparator value and the amount of integers that are below.

RTS_Question2.py takes two inputs from the user, a string of characters and an integer value that the string will be rotated by. 
The output is the new string value, with the number of characters rotated being added to the front of the original string.

RTS_Question3.pdf is an open answer document describing a change I would make to Python, my favorite programming language.
